echo "# SocketCommunication

This project demonstrates a simple socket communication setup in Python, including a server and a client script.

## Files

- Server.py: Contains the server code.
- Client.py: Contains the client code.

## Prerequisites

Before running the server and client, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x: You can download it from python.org.

## How to Run

### Server

1. Navigate to the directory containing the Server.py file.
2. Run the server script:
   \`\`\`sh
   python Server.py
   \`\`\`
   You should see a message indicating that the server is listening on localhost:5000.

### Client

1. Navigate to the directory containing the Client.py file.
2. Run the client script:
   \`\`\`sh
   python Client.py
   \`\`\`
   You should see a message indicating that a connection was made to the server.

## Example Output

### Server Output

\`\`\`
Server listening on localhost:5000
Got connection from ('127.0.0.1', 65432)
\`\`\`

### Client Output

\`\`\`
Result is 0
\`\`\`

## Troubleshooting

- **Connection Refused**: Ensure the server is running and listening on the correct port before starting the client.
- **Firewall Issues**: Check if any firewall rules are blocking the connection.
